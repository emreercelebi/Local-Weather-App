# Local-Weather-App

Simple weather app that gets the user's location and utilizes the Open Weather Map API (https://openweathermap.org/current) to 
display the local weather. It includes a button that will toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The 'dist' folder contains the weather icons used (origin: https://github.com/manifestinteractive/weather-underground-icons).
